    content: `The human brain is naturally wired to focus on the negative. It's a survival mechanism known as the "negativity bias". Thousands of years ago, this helped us avoid predators. Today, it mostly just makes us anxious about emails.

    But here is the good news: Neuroplasticity. You can literally rewire your brain.

    1. **Gratitude Journaling:** Writing down three things you are grateful for every morning forces your brain to scan the environment for positives.
    2. **Reframing:** When a "bad" thing happens, ask yourself: "What is the lesson here?"
    3. **Mindfulness:** Observing your negative thoughts without judging them allows them to pass like clouds.

    Start today. Your brain is a muscle; train it well.`,

    - **Creative Rest:** Taking a walk in nature without your phone.
    - **Social Rest:** Spending time with people who energize you, not drain you.
